# Will I Have A Job? 🎰

A satirical website that parodies AI replacement anxiety with garish lottery ticket aesthetics.

- **Countdown Timer**: Live countdown to your job's "obsolescence date"
- **Odds Calculator**: Slot machine-style animation revealing your "survival odds"
- **Annoying Popups**: Escalating popup frequency mimicking predatory upskilling marketing
- **Garish Aesthetics**: Intentionally over-the-top lottery ticket design
- **Visual Effects**: Sparkles, confetti, and animations for maximum tackiness
- **Vulnerable Profiles**: Rotating fake LinkedIn-style profiles of "at-risk" workers
- **Fake Urgent Timer**: Never-ending countdown creating false urgency

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No frameworks, no build process
- **Zero Dependencies**: Completely self-contained
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting, easy deployment
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, respects reduced motion preferences

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The intentionally garish lottery ticket aesthetic serves the satire:

- **Gold and red color scheme**: Mimics scratch-off lottery tickets
- **Metallic gradients**: Over-the-top "luxurious" feel
- **Multiple shadows**: Excessive depth and embossing
- **Blinking and pulsing**: Creates false urgency
- **Slot machine effects**: Numbers "roll" like gambling machines

All of this reinforces how job replacement predictions often use psychological manipulation similar to gambling and predatory marketing.

## 🔊 Audio Files

The site references sound files but will function without them:

- `slot-machine.mp3`: Background ambiance
- `winner.mp3`: Winner sound effect
- `ding.mp3`: UI interaction sound

You can add your own sound files or remove audio functionality entirely.

## 🖼 Profile Images

The vulnerable profiles section uses placeholder images. To add real images:

1. Use AI-generated faces from [ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)
2. Save 10 images as `profile1.jpg` through `profile10.jpg`
3. Place in `assets/images/profiles/`

The site includes fallback SVG placeholders if images are missing.

## ♿ Accessibility

Despite the satirical nature, the site maintains accessibility:

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for dynamic content
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Screen reader compatibility
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Respects `prefers-contrast`
- Focus indicators

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a satirical art project, but contributions are welcome:

- Bug fixes
- New occupation predictions
- Additional popup messages
- Improved satirical notes
- Accessibility improvements

## ⚖️ License

This project is released into the public domain. Use it however you want.

## 💡 Inspiration

Created in response to the proliferation of AI replacement fear-mongering that often serves to sell expensive courses, certifications, and "upskilling" programs while creating unnecessary anxiety.

## 🎭 Disclaimer

This is satire. All predictions are fake. All statistics are made up. All profiles are fictional. Don't take career advice from lottery-themed websites.

**Remember**: AI is a tool that will change how we work, but predictions about specific jobs and timelines are speculation. Focus on learning what interests you, not what fear-mongering tells you to learn.
