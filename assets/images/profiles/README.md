## Recommended Source: AI-Generated Faces

**[ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)**

- Generates unique, realistic AI faces
- No copyright issues (faces don't exist)
- Free to use
- Perfect for satirical fake profiles

### How to Use:

1. Visit [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)
2. Refresh the page to generate a new face
3. Right-click and save the image
4. Rename to `profile1.jpg`, `profile2.jpg`, etc.

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG (for smaller file sizes)
- **Dimensions**: 400x400px minimum (square)
- **File Size**: Keep under 200KB each
- **Style**: Professional headshot style works best

## Alternative Sources

If you prefer different images:

- **[Generated.Photos](https://generated.photos/)** - Another AI face generator
- **[UI Faces](https://uifaces.co/)** - Curated avatar library
- **Stock Photos** - Use royalty-free stock photos (ensure proper licensing)

## Fallback Behavior

The site includes SVG placeholder fallbacks if images are missing:

- A simple gray square with "Profile" text
- Site functionality is not affected
- Profile rotation still works

So if you want to launch without images, that's fine - just be aware they'll show placeholders.

## Diversity & Representation

When selecting/generating faces, aim for diversity:

- Various ages (20s-50s)
- Different genders
- Variety of ethnicities
- Professional appearance

This makes the satire more effective and inclusive.

## Privacy & Ethics

**Important**: DO NOT use real people's photos without permission.

- Never use actual LinkedIn photos
- Don't use photos of real people
- Stick to AI-generated or licensed stock photos
- This is satire, but respect people's privacy

## Format Conversion

If you have PNG files, convert to JPG:

### Using ImageMagick (command line):
```bash
convert profile.png -quality 85 profile.jpg
```

### Using Online Tools:
- [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com/) - Compress and convert
