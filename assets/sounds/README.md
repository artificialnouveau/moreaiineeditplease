## Optional: Site Works Without Audio

The website is designed to gracefully handle missing audio files:

- All audio playback fails silently
- Visual experience is not affected
- The audio unlock overlay will not appear if files are missing

If you don't want audio, simply leave this directory empty or delete the audio references from `audio.js`.
